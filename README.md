# Decidio

Data driven decision making

## About

We make thousands of small choices every day. And most of the time we actually have the winning option picked out before we're fully aware that there's even a choice to be made. But a few times in our lives we're confronted with truly difficult decisions, choices with consequences we know will be life-changing. At the end of the day, we choose the path that feels right, but getting to a place where anything feels right can be a long process.

That's where decidio comes in. To help you get to the end of that long decision making process, decidio helps you enumerate all of the relevant factors and then plots visualizations that help you come to terms with your preferences. Only you can know which choice feels right, but by making your preferencecs explicit decidio will help you start to overcome uncertainty.
